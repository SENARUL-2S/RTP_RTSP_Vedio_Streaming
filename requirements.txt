# RTSP/RTP Video Streaming Lab - Dependencies
# Real-Time Streaming Protocol and Real-time Transport Protocol implementation

# Core dependencies for GUI and image processing
Pillow>=9.0.0              # PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image/video processing
                          # Required for JPEG frame handling and GUI display

# Video processing dependencies for MP4 support
opencv-python>=4.5.0       # Computer Vision library for MP4 video processing
numpy>=1.21.0              # Numerical processing for video frame manipulation

# Development and testing (optional)
# pytest>=6.0.0          # Testing framework
# black>=21.0.0           # Code formatting

# Note: This project uses only Python standard library modules plus Pillow
# Standard modules used:
# - socket (TCP/UDP networking)
# - threading (concurrent client handling)  
# - struct (RTP packet encoding/decoding)
# - tkinter (GUI interface - included with Python)
# - time, os, io (system utilities)

# Installation command:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Quick install (minimum required):
# pip install Pillow
